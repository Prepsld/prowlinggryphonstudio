                    Utilizing MongoDB, this is my simple implementation of a

                    This is my attempt at combining both a login and protected
                    page together. As well, I wanted to fix my issues with the
                    sign in page not redirecting properly.In this test, I have a
                    custom sign in page that allows you to sign in with a
                    username and password, or with your google account. If you
                    are successful, you will be redirected to the same page, and
                    clicking the modal with give you the authorized page!

                    This is a simple page that allows you to enter a username
                    and comment and submit it to a database. I had a lot of
                    trouble with this one, but I finally got it working!

                    My dream goal. One day I hope to be able to create my own
                    video game, inspired by my favorite game of all time, X-Com:
                    Terror from the Deep. I have a lot of ideas, but I need to
                    learn a lot more before I can even begin to start this
                    project. This page will be a continuous work in progress, as
                    I learn more and more about game design and development.
