        Hello there, welcome to my webpage! Over my two year program at the
        Southern Alberta Institute of Technology I have learned several useful
        skills, such as: HTML, CSS, Javascript, React, Node.js, and SQL. I have
        also learned Object Oriented Programming using both Java and C#. My
        passion one day is to create retro styled video games, and I am
        currently working on a project using Unity and C#.
