# My Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio, a showcase of my backend development skills! This project is built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and was bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Purpose

This portfolio serves as a demonstration of my expertise in backend development. Through various features and projects, I aim to highlight my proficiency in creating robust and efficient solutions, particularly in handling server-side logic, database interactions, and API integrations.

## Folder Structure

- **`app/`**: Holds the website together. All of my pages, components and routes are in here. 
- **`components/`**: Contains reusable React components used across pages.
- **`lib/`**: Holds my MongoDb connection.
- **`api/`**: Holds my routers that allow me to connect to MongoDb, use NextAuth, and send emails from the website to myself.
